    description: The radioactive element astatine exists only in trace amounts in nature. Its properties can therefore only be explored by study of the minute quantities of artificially produced isotopes or by performing theoretical calculations. One of the most important properties influencing the chemical behaviour is the energy required to remove one electron from the valence shell, referred to as the ionization potential.

# Biography

I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of North Texas, under the supervision of Prof. Yunhe Feng. My research interests include Responsible AI, Large Language Models, and Continual Learning.
 
Before joining UNT, I obtained a Master's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research experience includes the simulation of composite materials and the application of continual learning techniques to medical image segmentation. I combined the Segment Anything Model with regularization strategies to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Prospecting Technology and Engineering from the China University of Petroleum, Beijing, where I conducted research on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks for seismic wave classification.

I primarily program in Python and have experience with C++ and C. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and running, and I have successfully completed a full marathon.
